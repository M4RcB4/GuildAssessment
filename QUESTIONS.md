> "5 small dogs, 3 medium dogs, 7 large dogs, and a leftover food supply of 17lbs. I should expect the function would tell me to order 363.6 lbs."

- I'd be shocked if I am correct but this test case doesn't seem accurate. I can't work backward into this answer.

> "What should be returned if the amount of food left over exceeds the food required including extra?(e.g. assertEqual(myShelter.orderAmount(1,0,0,100), 0))

- This is currently set to return 0 if the current amount required including extra less the leftOver is less than 0.
